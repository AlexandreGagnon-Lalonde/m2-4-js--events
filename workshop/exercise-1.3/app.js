// Exercise 2.3
// ------------
// DON'T COPY/PASTE THE LAST EXERCISE. REWRITE IT FROM SCRATCH! (This is the last time.)
// Similar to the last exercise, write an app that gives the user
// a random amount of time (up to 5 seconds) to click the screen.

// It would be a good idea to create a new function that will manage the whole game.
